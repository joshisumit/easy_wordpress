# Easy Wordpress

**Easy Wordpress** easily creates wordpress hosting environment.

**Easy Wordpress** is a shell script that rapidly installs wordpress on Ubuntu 12.04, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to install/configure LEMP Stack(Linux,nginx,MySQL,PHP). :)
- If you have already installed LEMP Stack, then it directly installs Wordpress on it.
- In a few minutes you'll be set up with a minimal, wordpress environment like the one below 
(giving you more time to spend on writing epic blog posts!)
 


##Pre-requisites

1. This script requires sudo permission for its execution or it should be executed with root user.
2. This script requires `sample_nginx_config` file for its execution.
3. This script installs mysql with username=`root` and password=`sumit`. You should change your mysql password once it is installed.
